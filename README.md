# Evaluating Project Safe Neighborhoods Dallas: Effects on Violent Crime and Trauma Volume



## Violent crime rates

Violent crime includes robbery, aggravated assault, & murder/non-negligent homicide.  

Data on these index violent crimes were obtained from Dallas Police & from all other municipalities in Dallas County from January 2015 through December 2020.

Nonlinear models controlling for seasonality, temporal dependency, and geospatial dependency were fit to the data.  These models were then used to derive crime rates per 100,000 population.  The model predictions are plotted with 95% simultaneous confidence intervals.  Notably, the first four months of data are not shown on the figures since violent crime rates from the four prior months were used as predictors in the model to account for strong temporal dependency. 


Estimates of the first derivatives were used to find and determine periods of significant changes in violent crime.

Violent crime was consistently higher in the target area than the rest of the city of Dallas & the countywide average. 
<br>


From Nov. 2017 to July 2018, violent crime in the target area was significantly higher than in the non-target area of Dallas.

The significant difference in violent crime rates between the target and non-target regions of Dallas ended due to significant increases in the non-target area between Feb. 2018 and Feb. 2019. However, violent crime never significantly changed in the target area.

First derivatives >0 indicate violent crime is increasing. First derivatives <0 indicate violent crime is decreasing. When the 95% CI for the first derivatives does not contain 0, that indicates a period of significant change; these periods are shown with darker grays and bolded lines.

## Crime-related trauma volume

To assess trauma volume, we queried the hospitalâ€™s trauma registry for monthly counts of 1) patients presenting with intentional non-self-inflicted gunshot wounds and 2) patients presenting with any intentional/assaultive injuries (e.g., aggravated assault, stab wounds, gunshot wounds).  As the hospital became a level II trauma center in 2016, these data span from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020.

These data were then modeled using methods analogous to those used for violent crime. These models were then used to derive injury rates per 100 trauma encounters.  The model predictions are plotted with 95% simultaneous confidence intervals.

Estimates of the first derivatives were used to find and determine periods of significant changes.

After long-running decreases, firearm & assaultive injuries began to rise after PSND.
